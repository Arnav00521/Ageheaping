# Ageheaping
Ado file for whipple and myers index
This repository contains general-purpose Stata .ado commands developed to compute Whipple’s Index and Myers’ Blended Index—two commonly used indicators for detecting age heaping in demographic data. These commands were created as part of an internship project at the Institute of Economic Growth (IEG) using data from sources such as NFHS-5.
whippletf.ado – Calculates Whipple’s Index disaggregated by state, sex, and residence (urban/rural).

myersstate1.ado – Computes Myers’ Blended Index state-wise using terminal digit analysis.
